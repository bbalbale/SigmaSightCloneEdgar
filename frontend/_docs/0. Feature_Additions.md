# Backend
- Don't see a script to pull company profiles

# Sandbox
- Cron jobs in Railway Sandbox are not occuring - docker instance is crashing

# Target Price
- Target prices need to be aggregated and saved to create a portfolio target return for lons/shorts/optons and the rest of the portfolio. Portfolio Returns are now being calculated only on the frontend. Need an API to save this to the database and it will likely require an alembic migration

# Portfolio Equity
- balances did not update to encorporate P&L. calculations engine changed to offer daily snapshot updates than then update the portoflio equity

# Portfolio Question
- Do we want to allow users to load up multiple portfolios so they can track across multiple banks/sources? Might be a good hook for users

# First API Calls
- Factor Exposure hits 2 timeouts before loading
- Portfolio Holdigs hits 2 timeouts before loading

# Correlcation Matrix doesn't seem accurate (see NVDA). 
- Implemented fix where we were not storing full correleation clusters
- Quality improvements made to accuracy of the analysis
- Seeded data hard coded mock data on the seed date and this was never refershed. Changing the seeding process to pull data from yfinance


# Factor analysis doesn't seem accurate
- Moved to a multi-variable analysis
- Pulled 180 days of data through yfinance - were limiting ourselves to 59 days. 
- New factor analysis plan being executed - will require alembic migrations, however. 

# Stress test doesn't give us any results
- Portfolios were not calculating net and gross exposure correctly. Moved to using calculated exposures, which should be in the db.
- Make sure stress testing is the last batch action, after factor exposures and exposure calcs

# No Diversificaiton Score

# Chat
- We have two version of chat running now.

## Backend System (/app/agent/ and /app/api/v1/chat/):
- Uses OpenAI Responses API (different from Chat Completions)
- Server-side API key management (secure)
- Conversation persistence in PostgreSQL database
- User authentication & authorization per conversation
- Centralized rate limiting and cost control
- Audit trail and logging of all AI interactions
- Tools have direct database access for complex operations
- Production-ready with retry logic, fallbacks, error handling

## Frontend System (just built):
- Uses OpenAI Chat Completions API (direct from browser)
- API key exposed in browser code (less secure)
- Conversations only in Zustand/localStorage (ephemeral)
- No server-side logging or auditing
- Tools limited to what frontend services can access
- Simpler, faster for demos and prototyping

### What Backend APIs Currently Exist:

  ✅ Conversations (already available):
  - POST /api/v1/chat/conversations - Create conversation
  - GET /api/v1/chat/conversations/{id} - Get conversation metadata
  - GET /api/v1/chat/conversations - List conversations
  - PUT /api/v1/chat/conversations/{id}/mode - Change mode
  - DELETE /api/v1/chat/conversations/{id} - Delete conversation

  ✅ Messages (partial):
  - POST /api/v1/chat/send - Send message + stream response (also saves to DB)

  ❌ Missing (needed for your use case):
  - GET /api/v1/chat/conversations/{id}/messages - Retrieve message history
  - POST /api/v1/chat/conversations/{id}/messages/bulk - Save multiple messages at once

  What We Need to Build to connect the two systems

  Backend Side (2 new endpoints needed):

  1. Get Message History Endpoint
  GET /api/v1/chat/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages
    - Returns array of messages for a conversation
    - Ordered chronologically
    - Paginated (limit/offset)
  2. Bulk Save Messages Endpoint
  POST /api/v1/chat/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages/bulk
    - Accepts array of messages
    - Saves all messages in one transaction
    - Returns saved message IDs

  Frontend Side (new service):

  Create frontend/src/services/chatPersistenceService.ts:
  - getConversationHistory(conversationId) - calls GET endpoint
  - saveMessages(conversationId, messages[]) - calls POST bulk endpoint
  - Integrates with existing chatService (frontend/src/services/chatService.ts)

  Proposed Flow:

  1. User opens chat
     ├─> chatPersistenceService.getConversationHistory(id)
     └─> Load from backend DB into Zustand

  2. User sends messages
     ├─> chatService.streamResponse() // Fast OpenAI direct
     └─> Messages stored in Zustand/localStorage

  3. After conversation (on close/timer)
     ├─> chatPersistenceService.saveMessages(id, messages)
     └─> Backend saves to PostgreSQL for audit/multi-device

  Benefits of This Approach:

  ✅ Fast real-time chat (direct OpenAI)
  ✅ Persistence for audit trails
  ✅ Multi-device conversation recovery
  ✅ No API key in browser (eventually can proxy)
  ✅ Minimal backend overhead (bulk operations)
