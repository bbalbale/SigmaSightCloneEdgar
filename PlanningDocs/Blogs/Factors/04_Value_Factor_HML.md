## The Most Controversial Factor

No factor in finance has been declared dead more often—or proven more resilient—than value.

"Value is dead." We heard it in the late 1990s, right before the dot-com crash made value investors look like geniuses. We heard it throughout the 2010s, as growth stocks dominated year after year. We're hearing it again now.

And yet, over nearly a century of data, **cheap stocks have beaten expensive stocks by roughly 3-5% annually.** That's not a small edge—compounded over decades, it's the difference between comfortable retirement and generational wealth.

So what's going on? Is value dead, or is the obituary premature?

## What Is the Value Factor?

The value factor captures the tendency of "cheap" stocks to outperform "expensive" stocks over time.

**The classic measure: Book-to-Market Ratio**
- **Book value**: What the company's assets are worth on the balance sheet
- **Market value**: What investors are willing to pay for the company
- **High book-to-market** = Stock is cheap relative to assets = VALUE
- **Low book-to-market** = Stock is expensive relative to assets = GROWTH

**HML (High Minus Low)** is how academics measure it:
- Rank all stocks by book-to-market ratio
- **HML = Return of high B/M stocks - Return of low B/M stocks**

When HML is positive, value is outperforming. When negative, growth is winning.

### Other Value Measures

Book-to-market isn't the only way to measure value:

| Measure | Formula | What It Captures |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| P/E Ratio | Price / Earnings | Earnings cheapness |
| P/B Ratio | Price / Book Value | Asset cheapness |
| P/S Ratio | Price / Sales | Revenue cheapness |
| P/CF Ratio | Price / Cash Flow | Cash generation cheapness |
| EV/EBITDA | Enterprise Value / EBITDA | Operating cheapness |

Most factor models combine several measures. A stock that's cheap on multiple metrics is a stronger value bet.

## The Evidence: Does Cheap Really Beat Expensive?

### The Long-Term Data

From 1926 to 2023:

| Category | Annualized Return |
|----------|-------------------|
| Value (High B/M) | 12.5% |
| Growth (Low B/M) | 9.5% |
| Value Premium | ~3.0% |

The value premium shows up in:
- U.S. stocks (where it was discovered)
- International developed markets
- Emerging markets
- Even bonds and currencies

It's one of the most replicated findings in all of finance.

### The Painful 2010s

Then came the 2010s:

| Year | Value vs. Growth |
|------|------------------|
| 2010 | Value +6% |
| 2011 | Value +5% |
| 2012 | Growth +2% |
| 2013 | Growth +7% |
| 2014 | Growth +5% |
| 2015 | Growth +3% |
| 2016 | Value +10% |
| 2017 | Growth +13% |
| 2018 | Growth +2% |
| 2019 | Growth +8% |
| **Decade** | **Growth +35% cumulative** |

A decade of underperformance. Value investors suffered. Many gave up.

### The 2020s: Value's Revenge?

Then 2022 happened. Rising rates, inflation fears, and a tech crash:

- **2022**: Value beat growth by 22 percentage points
- **2023**: Growth rebounded (AI boom)
- **2024**: Mixed results

The factor is very much alive—just streaky.

## Why Does Value Work?

Two competing explanations:

### The Risk-Based Explanation

Value stocks are cheap for a reason—they're riskier:

1. **Financial distress**: Many value stocks are struggling companies
2. **Cyclicality**: Value stocks are often in cyclical industries
3. **Operating leverage**: High fixed costs amplify profit swings
4. **Duration risk**: Value stocks are more sensitive to interest rates
5. **Uncertainty**: Markets are unsure about turnaround prospects

Investors demand compensation for these risks → higher expected returns.

### The Behavioral Explanation

Investors systematically overpay for growth:

1. **Extrapolation bias**: We assume recent growth will continue forever
2. **Glamour stocks**: Exciting stories get bid up beyond fair value
3. **Lottery preferences**: We overpay for the chance of huge gains
4. **Career risk**: Fund managers get fired for owning boring value stocks
5. **Narrative fallacy**: Growth stocks have better stories

**Both explanations are probably true.** Value stocks are riskier AND systematically underpriced.

## The Value vs. Growth Divide

Let's make this concrete with examples:

### Classic Value Stocks (2024)
- **Banks**: JPMorgan, Bank of America (low P/E, high book value)
- **Energy**: Exxon, Chevron (cheap on cash flow)
- **Industrials**: Caterpillar, Deere (cyclical, asset-heavy)
- **Tobacco**: Altria, Philip Morris (cheap but declining)

### Classic Growth Stocks (2024)
- **Tech**: Nvidia, Microsoft, Google (high P/E, high growth)
- **Consumer**: Amazon, Tesla (expensive on all metrics)
- **Healthcare**: Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk (premium for growth)
- **Fintech**: PayPal, Block (growth expectations priced in)

The divide isn't always clean—Apple has become more value-like, while some banks are growth plays.

## The "Death of Value" Narrative

Every decade, someone writes an article explaining why value is permanently dead. The arguments change:

**1999**: "The internet changes everything. Old-economy value stocks are dinosaurs."
*What happened*: Dot-com crash. Value crushed growth for 7 straight years.

**2015**: "Disruptive technology favors asset-light growth companies. Value is outdated."
*What happened*: Still waiting, but 2022 was brutal for growth.

**2023**: "AI will make value metrics obsolete. Only growth matters."
*What happened*: TBD. But we've heard this before.

The pattern: Value underperforms → narratives emerge to explain it → value comes back.

### Why Value Might Really Be Different This Time (Devil's Advocate)

Some credible arguments for structural change:

1. **Intangible assets**: R&D, brand value don't show up in book value
2. **Winner-take-all**: Network effects concentrate returns in a few companies
3. **Low rates environment**: Favors long-duration growth assets
4. **Passive investing**: Forces money into market-cap weighted indices (favoring large growth)

These are real forces. But they don't explain why value has worked across 100 years and dozens of countries.

## Your Portfolio's Value Exposure

Most investors have strong—often unintentional—value or growth tilts.

### Signs You're Growth-Tilted
- Heavy tech allocation
- Own mostly large caps
- Attracted to "exciting" stories
- Holdings have high P/E ratios
- Most positions are profitable, high-margin

### Signs You're Value-Tilted
- Heavy financial, energy, industrial allocation
- Own dividend-paying stocks
- Attracted to "bargains"
- Holdings have low P/E ratios
- Some positions are struggling companies

### The Hidden Growth Tilt

Here's what most people don't realize: **the S&P 500 has a significant growth tilt.**

Market-cap weighting means the index automatically holds more of whatever has gone up. As tech stocks soared in the 2010s, the S&P became increasingly growth-heavy. By 2021, tech was nearly 30% of the index.

If you "just own the index," you're making a growth bet—whether you intended to or not.

## How to Think About Value In Your Portfolio

### The Strategic Question

Should you tilt toward value? Consider:

1. **Time horizon**: Value underperformance can last 10+ years. Can you wait?
2. **Risk tolerance**: Value stocks are more volatile and can fall hard
3. **Behavioral fitness**: Can you hold cheap, ugly stocks when growth is soaring?
4. **Current valuations**: How cheap is value relative to growth right now?

### A Reasonable Approach

For most long-term investors:

- **Start with market weights** (accepting modest growth tilt)
- **Consider 10-20% value tilt** if you have 15+ year horizon
- **Prefer small cap value** (where the premium is strongest)
- **Use factor funds** rather than picking value stocks yourself
- **Rebalance periodically** to maintain your target exposure

### The Rebalancing Bonus

Here's a powerful insight: **rebalancing between value and growth adds returns.**

When growth is soaring, you sell some and buy value (cheap). When value rallies, you sell some and buy growth (now cheaper). This systematic "buy low, sell high" adds roughly 0.5-1% annually to returns.
