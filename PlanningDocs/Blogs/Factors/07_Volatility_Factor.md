## The Most Uncomfortable Finding in Finance

Here's something that makes finance professors squirm:

**Boring, low-volatility stocks have beaten exciting, high-volatility stocks for nearly a century.**

This isn't supposed to happen. The foundational principle of finance—dating back to the 1960s—is that you get paid for taking risk. Higher risk should mean higher returns. That's why stocks beat bonds, and bonds beat cash.

But within the stock market, the opposite is true. The safest stocks have outperformed the riskiest stocks on both an absolute AND risk-adjusted basis.

Welcome to the low volatility anomaly—the finding that keeps breaking finance theory.

## What Is the Volatility Factor?

The volatility factor captures the tendency of low-volatility stocks to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns (and often superior absolute returns) compared to high-volatility stocks.

**How it's measured:**
- Calculate the historical volatility (standard deviation of returns) for each stock
- Rank stocks from lowest to highest volatility
- **Low Vol - High Vol = Volatility Factor**

When this is positive, low-vol is outperforming. When negative, high-vol is winning.

**Note**: This is the inverse of what theory predicts. We'd expect high-volatility stocks to outperform to compensate for their risk.

## The Evidence: Boring Really Does Win

### Historical Performance (1963-2023)

| Quintile | Annualized Return | Volatility | Sharpe Ratio |
|----------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| Lowest Vol (Q1) | 10.5% | 12% | 0.65 |
| Q2 | 10.8% | 15% | 0.55 |
| Q3 | 10.2% | 18% | 0.42 |
| Q4 | 9.5% | 22% | 0.32 |
| Highest Vol (Q5) | 7.8% | 28% | 0.18 |

The lowest-volatility stocks delivered:
- **Higher absolute returns** than the highest-vol stocks
- **Much better risk-adjusted returns** (Sharpe ratio 3x higher)
- **With far less volatility** (12% vs. 28%)

This is extraordinary. It's like finding that economy cars get better gas mileage AND go faster than sports cars.

### The Numbers Don't Lie

$10,000 invested in 1963:
- Lowest volatility quintile → ~$2.5 million today
- Highest volatility quintile → ~$500,000 today
- With less than half the volatility

The boring stocks won by a factor of 5x.

## Why Does This Happen?

This anomaly is so strange that researchers have proposed many explanations:

### 1. Lottery Preferences

Investors treat high-volatility stocks like lottery tickets. They're willing to overpay for the small chance of huge gains. This drives up prices and drives down future returns.

The evidence: High-vol stocks are disproportionately held by retail investors who exhibit lottery-seeking behavior.

### 2. Leverage Constraints

Many investors can't use leverage (401k accounts, pension funds, etc.). If they want higher returns, they can't lever up low-vol stocks. Instead, they buy high-vol stocks for the excitement.

This creates excess demand for high-vol stocks, pushing up prices and reducing returns.

### 3. Benchmark Tracking

Fund managers are judged against benchmarks. Owning low-vol stocks means potentially underperforming during market rallies. Career risk pushes managers toward high-vol stocks.

If everyone is avoiding low-vol stocks, they become underpriced.

### 4. Attention and Overconfidence

High-volatility stocks get more media coverage, more analyst attention, and more retail trading. This attention leads to overpricing.

Low-vol stocks are boring—nobody writes articles about Johnson & Johnson's steady 3% annual growth.

### 5. The Compounding Effect

Here's a mathematical reality: **volatility destroys compound returns.**

Example:
- Stock A: +20%, then -20% = -4% total return
- Stock B: +10%, then -10% = -1% total return

Same average return, different outcomes. High volatility hurts compound growth through the "volatility drag."

## Volatility and Your Portfolio

### Understanding Volatility Metrics

SigmaSight tracks several volatility measures:

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| Historical Volatility | Standard deviation of past returns |
| Implied Volatility | Market's expectation of future volatility (from options) |
| Beta | Volatility relative to the market |
| Maximum Drawdown | Largest peak-to-trough decline |
| Downside Deviation | Volatility of negative returns only |

### What Drives Portfolio Volatility?

Your portfolio's volatility comes from:

1. **Individual position volatility**: High-vol stocks add more volatility
2. **Position sizing**: Larger positions contribute more
3. **Correlations**: Highly correlated stocks multiply volatility
4. **Concentration**: Fewer positions = more volatility

You can have low-volatility stocks and still have a high-volatility portfolio if they're all correlated.

## Volatility Regimes: The Clustering Effect

Volatility doesn't randomly fluctuate—it clusters. High-vol periods bunch together, as do low-vol periods.

### The Pattern

- Calm markets → Stay calm for extended periods
- Volatile markets → Stay volatile for extended periods
- Transitions are sudden and hard to predict

### Practical Implications

1. If volatility is low today, it's likely to stay low tomorrow
2. When volatility spikes, expect it to remain elevated
3. Volatility regimes can persist for months or years

SigmaSight uses **HAR (Heterogeneous Autoregressive) models** to forecast volatility based on these clustering patterns.

## The Volatility Smile: What Your Portfolio's Vol Profile Tells You

### High-Volatility Portfolio Warning Signs
- Heavy tech/growth allocation
- Small cap tilt
- Concentrated positions
- High correlation among holdings
- Recent winners (momentum = higher vol)

### Low-Volatility Portfolio Characteristics
- Utilities, consumer staples, healthcare exposure
- Large cap tilt
- Dividend-paying stocks
- Cash or bonds as buffer
- Diversified, low-correlation holdings

### The Hidden Vol Problem

Many investors have higher volatility than they realize:

**Example**: A "diversified" tech portfolio

Positions: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Netflix

These are six different companies, but they:
- All move together (high correlation)
- All have above-market beta
- All are growth stocks
- All get hit in rate rises

Portfolio volatility: Much higher than any single position.

## HAR Volatility Forecasting

Traditional volatility measures are backward-looking. SigmaSight uses the **HAR model** for forward-looking estimates.

### How HAR Works

The HAR model captures volatility at multiple time scales:
- Daily volatility (short-term noise)
- Weekly volatility (medium-term trends)
- Monthly volatility (long-term regime)

By combining these, HAR produces more accurate volatility forecasts than simple historical measures.

### Why It Matters

Better volatility forecasting means:
- More accurate risk estimates
- Better position sizing
- Smarter rebalancing decisions
- Earlier warning of regime changes

## How to Use Volatility In Your Portfolio

### Strategy 1: Tilt Toward Low Vol

If you want smoother returns:
- Allocate 20-30% to a low-volatility factor ETF
- Underweight high-beta sectors
- Avoid concentrated positions in volatile stocks

### Strategy 2: Size Positions by Volatility

Risk parity approach:
- Equal risk contribution from each position
- Higher-vol stocks get smaller allocations
- Lower-vol stocks get larger allocations

Example:
- Johnson & Johnson (15% vol): 8% position
- Tesla (50% vol): 2.5% position

Same risk contribution, different dollar amounts.

### Strategy 3: Dynamic Volatility Management

Adjust exposure based on volatility regime:
- High-vol regime → Reduce equity exposure, add hedges
- Low-vol regime → Full equity exposure
- Requires discipline and systematic rules

### The Catch: Low Vol Can Underperform

Low-volatility strategies underperform during:
- Strong bull markets
- Risk-on rallies
- Momentum-driven markets

If the market returns 30%, your low-vol portfolio might only return 20%. That's the price of stability.
