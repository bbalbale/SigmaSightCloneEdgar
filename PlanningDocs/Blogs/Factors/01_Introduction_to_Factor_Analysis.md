## The Problem With How Most People Analyze Their Portfolio

Open any brokerage app and you'll see the same thing: a list of stocks, their prices, and whether they're up or down today. Maybe you'll get a pie chart showing your sector allocation. Perhaps a green or red number showing your total gain or loss.

This is how most investors think about their portfolios. "I own Apple, Microsoft, and some index funds. I'm diversified."

But here's what that view doesn't tell you:

- Why did your "diversified" portfolio drop 12% when the market only fell 8%?
- Why do all your stocks seem to move together, even though they're in different sectors?
- What hidden risks are you taking that you don't even know about?

The truth is, looking at your portfolio as a collection of individual stocks is like trying to understand the weather by looking at individual raindrops. You're missing the bigger picture.

**The professionals see something entirely different. They see factors.**

## What Are Factors, Anyway?

Think of factors as the invisible forces that drive stock returns. They're the underlying characteristics that explain why groups of stocks move together—and why your portfolio behaves the way it does.

Here's a simple analogy: Imagine you're trying to understand why some houses are more expensive than others. You could analyze each house individually, but that would take forever. Instead, you'd look at factors: square footage, number of bedrooms, school district, distance to downtown. These factors explain most of the price variation.

Stocks work the same way. Instead of analyzing thousands of companies individually, factor analysis identifies the common characteristics that drive returns:

- **Market exposure** (beta) - How sensitive is the stock to overall market moves?
- **Size** - Is it a small company or large company?
- **Value** - Is it cheap relative to its fundamentals, or expensive?
- **Momentum** - Has it been going up recently, or down?
- **Quality** - Is it profitable with low debt, or struggling?
- **Volatility** - How much does it bounce around?

These factors aren't just academic abstractions. They explain roughly 90% of a diversified portfolio's returns. The other 10%? That's the stock-specific stuff—the CEO getting arrested, the surprise earnings beat, the product recall.

**When you understand your factor exposures, you understand your portfolio.**

## A Brief History: How We Got Here

Factor investing isn't new. It's the culmination of 70 years of financial research.

**1952 - Harry Markowitz** introduced Modern Portfolio Theory, showing that diversification could reduce risk without sacrificing return. Revolutionary at the time, but it treated all stocks as unique snowflakes.

**1964 - William Sharpe** developed the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), introducing beta—the first factor. Beta measures how much a stock moves relative to the market. A stock with beta of 1.5 rises 15% when the market rises 10%. Simple, powerful, but incomplete.

**1992 - Eugene Fama and Kenneth French** (yes, that Fama—the Nobel laureate) showed that beta alone doesn't explain returns. They added two more factors: size (small stocks outperform) and value (cheap stocks outperform). The "Fama-French Three-Factor Model" became the gold standard.

**1997 - Mark Carhart** added momentum—the tendency for recent winners to keep winning. Four factors now.

**2015 - Fama and French** expanded to five factors, adding profitability and investment patterns.

Today, practitioners use anywhere from 5 to 7 core factors, with some quant funds tracking hundreds of variations. But the core insight remains: **a handful of factors explain most of what happens in markets.**

## Why This Matters For You

Here's where it gets practical. Factor analysis reveals three things about your portfolio:

### 1. Your Real Risks

You might think you're diversified because you own 30 stocks across different sectors. But if they're all high-beta growth stocks, you're making a massive bet on the market going up. Factor analysis reveals this.

A portfolio of Amazon, Tesla, Nvidia, and Netflix might look "diversified" by name. But factor analysis would show:
- Very high beta (aggressive market exposure)
- Negative value tilt (all expensive stocks)
- High momentum exposure (all recent winners)
- Low quality scores (high volatility, aggressive investments)

That's not diversification. That's a concentrated bet on growth and momentum continuing. When those factors reverse—as they did in 2022—the portfolio gets crushed.

### 2. Your Unintended Bets

Most investors accidentally tilt their portfolios toward certain factors without realizing it.

Do you like "good companies"? You probably have a quality tilt.
Do you hunt for bargains? You likely have a value tilt.
Do you buy stocks that have been going up? That's momentum.

None of these tilts are bad. But you should know you're making them. Otherwise, you might be surprised when "your style" underperforms for years.

### 3. Your Expected Returns

Different factors have different long-term expected returns. Value has historically returned 3-5% annually above growth. Small caps have beaten large caps by 2-3% over very long periods. Momentum has been the strongest factor historically—but also the most dangerous when it reverses.

Understanding your factor exposures helps you understand what returns to expect—and what risks you're taking to get them.

## What the Pros See That You Don't

When a hedge fund portfolio manager looks at their book, they don't see "100 stocks across 11 sectors." They see:

- Beta: 1.2 (20% more market exposure than S&P 500)
- Size: -0.15 (slight large-cap tilt)
- Value: +0.3 (moderate value tilt)
- Momentum: +0.1 (slight momentum tilt)
- Quality: +0.25 (meaningful quality tilt)

They know exactly what bets they're making. When something moves, they know why.

When their portfolio drops 5% on a day the market is down 4%, they're not surprised. They expected it—their beta is 1.2. When value stocks rally, they know they'll participate. When momentum crashes, they know their exposure is limited.

**This is the edge that institutional investors have always had. Not better stock picks—better risk awareness.**

## The SigmaSight Approach

Until recently, this kind of analysis required expensive Bloomberg terminals, proprietary data feeds, and quant teams. It was the exclusive domain of hedge funds and institutional investors.

SigmaSight changes that.

We've built a platform that gives individual investors the same factor analytics that professionals use. Upload your portfolio, and within seconds you'll see:

- Your exposure to each major factor
- How your exposures compare to benchmarks
- Where you have concentration risk
- Which factors are driving your returns
- What happens to your portfolio under stress scenarios

You don't need a PhD in finance to use it. The insights are presented clearly, with explanations of what they mean and what to do about them.

## What's Next

This is the first post in our series on factor investing. Over the coming weeks, we'll dive deep into each factor:

- **Beta**: The one number every investor should know
- **Size**: Why small and large stocks behave differently
- **Value**: The factor that refuses to die
- **Momentum**: Why winners keep winning (until they don't)
- **Quality**: More than just "buy good companies"
- **Volatility**: Why boring often beats exciting

By the end, you'll understand your portfolio in a way most investors never will. You'll see the invisible forces at work. And you'll be able to make better, more informed decisions.

**Your portfolio is more than a list of stocks. It's time to see what's really driving it.**
