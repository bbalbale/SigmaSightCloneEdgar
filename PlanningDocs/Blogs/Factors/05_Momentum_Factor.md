## The Factor That Shouldn't Exist

Of all the factors in finance, momentum is the most puzzling. It's also been the most profitable.

The idea is simple: **stocks that have gone up recently tend to keep going up. Stocks that have gone down tend to keep going down.**

This shouldn't work. Every finance textbook says prices reflect all available information. If a stock is going up, that information should already be priced in. There should be no edge in buying winners.

And yet, momentum has delivered roughly **4-8% annual returns** above the market—the strongest factor premium documented. It works in U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities. It's been working for over 200 years of data.

Either markets are less efficient than we thought, or something strange is happening in human psychology.

## What Is the Momentum Factor?

Momentum measures the tendency of recent winners to outperform recent losers over the following months.

**The Classic Definition (Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993)**:
- Look at stock returns over the past 12 months (skipping the most recent month)
- Rank stocks from best to worst performers
- Go long top 10%, short bottom 10%
- Hold for 3-12 months, then rebalance

**Why skip the last month?** Short-term reversal. In the immediate term (1 month), stocks tend to reverse. But from months 2-12, momentum dominates.

**UMD (Up Minus Down)** is how it's measured:
- **UMD = Return of past winners - Return of past losers**

When UMD is positive, momentum is working. When negative, momentum is crashing.

## The Evidence: Just How Strong Is Momentum?

The numbers are striking:

### Historical Performance (1927-2023)

| Strategy | Annualized Return | Sharpe Ratio |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Market (Buy and Hold) | 9.5% | 0.40 |
| Value (HML) | 3.5% | 0.30 |
| Size (SMB) | 2.5% | 0.20 |
| **Momentum (UMD)** | **6.5%** | **0.45** |

Momentum has been the single strongest factor premium—delivering nearly double the returns of value with better risk-adjusted performance.

### Global Evidence

| Market | Momentum Premium |
|--------|------------------|
| U.S. Stocks | 6-8% annually |
| International Developed | 5-7% annually |
| Emerging Markets | 4-6% annually |
| Currencies | 3-5% annually |
| Commodities | 4-6% annually |
| Bonds | 2-4% annually |

It works everywhere. That's unusual for a market anomaly.

## Why Does Momentum Work?

Unlike value and size, there's no good risk-based explanation for momentum. The premium is almost entirely behavioral.

### The Behavioral Explanation

1. **Underreaction**: Investors are slow to update beliefs. Good news takes time to be fully priced in.

2. **Herding**: People follow the crowd. As more investors buy winners, prices keep rising.

3. **Confirmation bias**: Investors seek information confirming their positions. Winners attract more positive attention.

4. **Disposition effect**: People sell winners too early (to lock in gains) and hold losers too long (to avoid regret). This slows price adjustment.

5. **Gradual information diffusion**: News spreads slowly through investor networks. Some investors are always behind.

### The Risk Explanation (Weaker)

Some argue momentum stocks are riskier:
- They crash spectacularly when they reverse
- They have higher beta
- They're more volatile

But the crash risk doesn't fully explain the premium. Momentum's Sharpe ratio is too good for a pure risk story.

## The Dark Side: Momentum Crashes

Momentum has a fatal flaw: **it crashes. Hard.**

Unlike value (which just underperforms slowly), momentum can lose 40-50% in a few months. The crashes are sudden, violent, and unpredictable.

### Historical Momentum Crashes

| Period | Momentum Return | Context |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| 1932 | -70% | Post-Depression reversal |
| 2000 | -40% | Dot-com bust |
| 2009 | -60% | Post-crisis rally |
| 2020 | -30% | COVID recovery |

The pattern: Momentum crashes when losers suddenly become winners. This happens during:
- Market bottoms (beaten-down stocks rally hard)
- Regime changes (new leadership emerges)
- Policy shifts (interest rate pivots)

### The 2009 Crash: A Case Study

In March 2009, the market bottomed. What happened to momentum?

- Previous winners (defensive stocks, quality companies) lagged
- Previous losers (financials, cyclicals, junk) soared
- Momentum strategy lost 50%+ in two months

If you were running a momentum strategy, you got destroyed precisely when you expected to be protected.

**This is why momentum is called "picking up pennies in front of a steamroller."**

## Momentum In Your Portfolio

You probably have momentum exposure whether you know it or not.

### Intentional Momentum

Some investors explicitly buy recent winners:
- Trend-following strategies
- Buying stocks "breaking out"
- Chasing hot sectors (AI stocks in 2023)

### Unintentional Momentum

More common—and more dangerous:

- **Not rebalancing**: If you haven't sold winners, you've accumulated momentum exposure
- **Index funds**: Cap-weighted indices have momentum tilt (winners get bigger weights)
- **Growth tilt**: Growth and momentum are correlated
- **Chasing performance**: Buying funds that did well recently

### Example: The Drifting Portfolio

Sarah invested $100,000 equally in 5 stocks in January 2020:
- Stock A: +150% (now $50,000)
- Stock B: +100% (now $40,000)
- Stock C: +50% (now $30,000)
- Stock D: +10% (now $22,000)
- Stock E: -30% (now $14,000)

Without rebalancing, Sarah's portfolio is now heavily concentrated in winners. She has massive momentum exposure.

If momentum reverses, her biggest positions (A and B) could fall the hardest. She's unintentionally betting on winners continuing to win.

## How to Handle Momentum

### Option 1: Ignore It

Reasonable approach. Momentum is hard to capture:
- Requires frequent trading (costs)
- Tax-inefficient
- Crash risk

If you're a buy-and-hold investor, just **rebalance regularly** to avoid unintended momentum accumulation.

### Option 2: Tilt Toward It (Cautiously)

If you want momentum exposure:
- Use a **momentum factor ETF** (they manage the complexity)
- Limit to **5-10% of portfolio**
- Combine with **value** (value and momentum are negatively correlated—great diversification)
- Have a **crash plan** (know what you'll do when it reverses)

### Option 3: Avoid It

If momentum makes you nervous:
- Rebalance frequently (sell winners, buy losers)
- Tilt toward value (anti-momentum)
- Avoid chasing hot sectors

### The Best Combination: Value + Momentum

Here's a secret from the quant world: **value and momentum are negatively correlated** but both have positive expected returns.

- Value: Buy cheap stocks (recent losers)
- Momentum: Buy expensive stocks (recent winners)

They seem to contradict each other. But in a portfolio, they diversify beautifully:

| Environment | Value | Momentum | Combined |
|-------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Normal markets | + | + | ++ |
| Growth rally | - | + | neutral |
| Value rally | + | - | neutral |
| Crash recovery | - - | - - | - - |

The combined portfolio is much smoother than either factor alone—except during crash recoveries, where both lose.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Momentum is the strongest factor**—~6-8% annual premium historically
2. **It's almost entirely behavioral**—not well explained by risk
3. **Momentum crashes are brutal**—40-60% losses possible in months
4. **You probably have momentum exposure** if you don't rebalance
5. **Value + Momentum = Great combination**—negative correlation, positive returns
6. **Respect the crash risk**—momentum rewards look like genius until they don't
