## The Question You Should Be Asking

When markets are calm, investors rarely ask: "What happens if everything goes wrong?"

But that's exactly when you should ask. The time to check your parachute is before you jump—not on the way down.

**Stress testing answers the question: How bad could it get?**

Not "how bad might it get on an average bad day." How bad could it get in a genuine crisis—2008, COVID crash, or something worse?

Most investors have no idea. They find out in real-time, when it's too late to do anything about it.

## What Is Stress Testing?

Stress testing simulates how your portfolio would perform under extreme but plausible scenarios.

It's not prediction. It's preparation.

A stress test asks: "If [crisis scenario] happened, and my positions moved according to their historical sensitivities, what would my portfolio lose?"

The goal isn't precision—markets are unpredictable. The goal is **awareness**. Knowing you might lose 35% in a severe recession is different from discovering it in real-time.

## The Scenarios That Matter

SigmaSight tests your portfolio against multiple crisis scenarios:

### 1. 2008 Financial Crisis Replay

**What happened**: Banking system collapse. S&P 500 fell 57% peak-to-trough. Credit markets froze. Global recession.

**Key characteristics**:
- Financials: -80%
- Cyclicals: -60%
- Quality/Defensives: -40%
- Treasuries: +20%
- Correlations spiked to 0.85+

**Why it matters**: Tests exposure to financial contagion and severe recession.

### 2. 2020 COVID Crash

**What happened**: Fastest 30% decline in history. Extreme volatility. Swift recovery.

**Key characteristics**:
- Broad market: -34% in 23 days
- Travel/Leisure: -50%+
- Tech: -30% (recovered fastest)
- Bonds: +5% initially, then volatile

**Why it matters**: Tests exposure to sudden liquidity shocks.

### 3. 2022 Rate Shock

**What happened**: Fastest rate hiking cycle in decades. Growth stocks crushed. Bonds fell alongside stocks.

**Key characteristics**:
- Growth stocks: -30%
- Tech (Nasdaq): -33%
- Long-duration bonds: -20%
- Value stocks: -5%
- Traditional 60/40: Failed

**Why it matters**: Tests exposure to inflation and rate sensitivity.

### 4. Stagflation Scenario

**Hypothetical**: High inflation + recession + rising rates simultaneously.

**Key characteristics**:
- Stocks: -30% to -40%
- Bonds: -10% to -15%
- Commodities: +20%
- Cash: Loses to inflation but preserves nominal value

**Why it matters**: Tests the "everything falls" scenario.

### 5. Tech Sector Collapse

**Modeled on 2000-2002**: Tech bubble bursts. Nasdaq fell 78%.

**Key characteristics**:
- Tech/Growth: -50% to -70%
- Value: Relatively flat or positive
- S&P 500: -45%
- Correlations within tech: Near 1.0

**Why it matters**: Tests concentrated tech exposure.

### 6. Custom Factor Shocks

Beyond historical scenarios, SigmaSight lets you test specific factor movements:

- "What if value beats growth by 20%?"
- "What if small caps crash 30%?"
- "What if momentum reverses sharply?"

## A Portfolio Stress Test Walkthrough

Let's stress test our sample portfolio from the previous posts:

| Position | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Apple | 14.3% |
| Microsoft | 16.8% |
| Amazon | 5.7% |
| JPMorgan | 9.8% |
| Johnson & Johnson | 9.3% |
| Nvidia | 10.8% |
| Bonds (BND) | 7.7% |
| Berkshire | 11.3% |
| Coca-Cola | 4.5% |
| Home Depot | 10.0% |

### Stress Test Results

| Scenario | S&P 500 | Your Portfolio | Difference |
|----------|---------|----------------|------------|
| **2008 Financial Crisis** | -57% | -48% | +9% |
| **2020 COVID Crash** | -34% | -29% | +5% |
| **2022 Rate Shock** | -25% | -23% | +2% |
| **Stagflation** | -35% | -31% | +4% |
| **Tech Collapse** | -45% | -38% | +7% |

### Interpreting the Results

**Good news**: Your portfolio outperforms the market in every stress scenario. The defensive positioning (bonds, quality tilt, JNJ, Coca-Cola) provides protection.

**Concerning news**: You'd still lose 29-48% in various scenarios. Is that acceptable?

**Key insight**: The tech collapse scenario is particularly relevant given your 42% exposure to tech-adjacent names (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA).

## Deep Dive: Position-Level Stress Impact

SigmaSight shows which positions hurt most:

### 2008 Scenario - Position Losses

| Position | Weight | Estimated Loss | Contribution to Portfolio Loss |
|----------|--------|----------------|------------------------------|
| JPMorgan | 9.8% | -75% | -7.4% |
| Nvidia | 10.8% | -65% | -7.0% |
| Apple | 14.3% | -55% | -7.9% |
| Microsoft | 16.8% | -50% | -8.4% |
| Home Depot | 10.0% | -55% | -5.5% |
| Amazon | 5.7% | -60% | -3.4% |
| Berkshire | 11.3% | -35% | -4.0% |
| Coca-Cola | 4.5% | -30% | -1.4% |
| J&J | 9.3% | -25% | -2.3% |
| Bonds (BND) | 7.7% | +10% | +0.8% |
| **Total** | 100% | | **-46.5%** |

**Key insight**: JPMorgan and Nvidia—combined 20.6% of portfolio—contribute 14.4% of losses (30% of total loss). Concentrated positions amplify stress losses.

## Using Stress Tests for Decision Making

### Question 1: Can You Handle the Worst Case?

If your portfolio might lose 45% in a severe crisis:
- Do you have an emergency fund outside this portfolio?
- Can you avoid selling at the bottom?
- Will you be able to sleep at night?

If the answer is "no," you need to reduce risk before the crisis hits.

### Question 2: Where Is Risk Concentrated?

Stress tests reveal concentration you might not see otherwise:
- JPMorgan is 9.8% of portfolio but 15% of crisis losses
- Your "diversified" tech exposure acts as a single block

Consider trimming positions that contribute disproportionate risk.

### Question 3: What Protects You?

Identify your "crisis assets":
- Bonds: Provided positive return in 2008 scenario
- J&J and Coca-Cola: Lost less than market
- Berkshire: Moderate losses, strong recovery historically

Do you have enough protection? Should you add more defensive positions?

### Question 4: Are You Compensated for the Risk?

High-risk positions should offer high expected returns:
- Nvidia: High stress loss, but potentially high growth
- JPMorgan: High stress loss in financials crisis specifically

Make sure concentrated risks are intentional bets, not accidents.

## Stress Testing Best Practices

### Test Regularly

Markets change. Your portfolio changes. Stress test quarterly or whenever you make significant changes.

### Test Multiple Scenarios

Don't fixate on one scenario. Different crises hurt different portfolios:
- Rate-sensitive portfolio: Hurt most by 2022 scenario
- Tech-heavy portfolio: Hurt most by tech collapse
- Value-heavy portfolio: Hurt most by value drawdown

### Look at Recovery, Not Just Drawdown

A 50% drawdown requires 100% gain to recover. Consider:
- How long might recovery take?
- Can you stay invested that long?
- What's your income/withdrawal needs during the crisis?

### Don't Over-Optimize

It's tempting to minimize stress losses. But:
- Maximum defense = Maximum missed gains
- Some risk is necessary for returns
- Balance protection with growth

## Taking Action After Stress Testing

### If Stress Losses Are Too High

1. **Add hedges**: Bonds, treasuries, defensive positions
2. **Reduce concentration**: Trim largest positions
3. **Diversify factors**: Add uncorrelated factor exposures
4. **Raise cash**: Cash doesn't fall (but loses to inflation)

### If Stress Losses Are Acceptable

1. **Document your reasoning**: Write down why this risk level is OK
2. **Set rebalancing rules**: Know when you'll act during crisis
3. **Avoid checking constantly**: Watching losses doesn't help
4. **Have dry powder**: Cash to invest at lower prices

### If You're Unsure

1. **Run more scenarios**: Test edges of your comfort zone
2. **Talk to advisor**: Professional perspective helps
3. **Start conservative**: You can add risk later
4. **Sleep on it**: Decisions made in calm weather are better
