## The Problem We Solve

Open your brokerage app. What do you see?

A list of stocks. Some green, some red. Maybe a pie chart showing you own "30% technology." A total account value that bounces around daily for reasons you can't quite explain.

This is how most people experience their investments. It's also completely inadequate.

**You're flying blind.**

When markets drop 5%, do you know if your portfolio should drop 5%, 8%, or 3%? When tech stocks rally, do you know how exposed you are? When "value" is in the news, do you know if that helps or hurts you?

Most investors don't. They find out the hard way.

## What the Professionals See

Walk into any hedge fund or institutional investment office. Their screens look nothing like your brokerage app.

They see:
- **Factor exposures**: How sensitive is our portfolio to each systematic risk?
- **Correlation matrices**: Which positions move together? Where's the real diversification?
- **Stress scenarios**: What happens if 2008 repeats? If rates spike? If growth crashes?
- **Concentration metrics**: Are we too exposed to any single bet?
- **Attribution analysis**: Which decisions actually drove our returns?

This isn't exotic. It's standard practice for anyone managing serious money. These tools have existed for decades—Bloomberg terminals, Barra risk models, sophisticated in-house systems.

But they've always been too expensive, too complex, or too inaccessible for individual investors.

**Until now.**

## Who Is SigmaSight For?

### Sophisticated Individual Investors
You actively manage your portfolio. You read financial news. You have opinions on markets. But you've never had tools to truly understand your risk exposures. SigmaSight changes that.

### High Net Worth Individuals
You have significant wealth to protect. You work with advisors but want to understand what's really happening in your portfolio. SigmaSight gives you the same view your institutional managers have.

### Family Offices
You manage multi-generational wealth across complex portfolios. You need institutional-quality risk management without building an in-house quant team. SigmaSight delivers.

## What Makes SigmaSight Different

### Not a Robo-Advisor
We don't manage your money. We don't tell you what to buy. We give you the information to make your own informed decisions. You stay in control.

### Not Just Performance Tracking
Most apps show you what happened. SigmaSight shows you why—and what might happen next. Understanding your risk is different from watching prices move.

### Not Oversimplified
We don't dumb down the analytics. Factor models, correlation matrices, HAR volatility forecasting—these are real quantitative tools. We just make them accessible.

### Not Black Box
We explain everything. What is beta? Why does value matter? How should you interpret a correlation of 0.7? SigmaSight educates as it analyzes.

## The Technology Behind SigmaSight

We've built a modern, robust platform:

- **Multi-source market data**: Real-time prices from multiple providers
- **8 calculation engines**: Portfolio analytics, factor analysis, risk metrics, stress testing
- **HAR volatility models**: Sophisticated forecasting used by institutional quants
- **AI integration**: Natural language analysis powered by state-of-the-art models
- **Bank-grade security**: Your portfolio data is encrypted and protected

This isn't a spreadsheet. It's the same caliber of technology used by hedge funds—packaged for individual investors.

---

## Why We Built This

The gap between institutional and retail investors has always seemed unfair.

Hedge funds have teams of quants analyzing factor exposures, running stress tests, monitoring concentration risk. Individual investors get pie charts and green/red arrows.

The information asymmetry is staggering. And it costs retail investors real money—through unintended risk exposures, poor diversification, and surprises during market stress.

We believe everyone deserves to understand their portfolio at a professional level. Not just the wealthy. Not just the connected. Everyone.

**SigmaSight is our answer.**
