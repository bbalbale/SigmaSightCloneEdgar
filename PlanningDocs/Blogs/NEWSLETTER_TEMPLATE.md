## Section 1: Factor Pulse

**Length**: 150-200 words
**Purpose**: Quick summary of factor performance this week

### Template:

---

**FACTOR PULSE**

This week's factor performance (vs. S&P 500):

| Factor | Weekly Return | MTD |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Value (HML) | +X.X% | +X.X% |
| Momentum (UMD) | +X.X% | +X.X% |
| Size (SMB) | +X.X% | +X.X% |
| Quality (QMJ) | +X.X% | +X.X% |
| Low Vol | +X.X% | +X.X% |

**The Takeaway**: [2-3 sentences summarizing what's working, what isn't, and why it matters]

[Example: "Value continued its outperformance streak as rising rate expectations favored cheaper stocks over high-duration growth names. Momentum showed signs of stress following the sharp sector rotation mid-week. If you're heavily tilted toward recent winners, this is worth watching."]

**FACTOR PULSE**

This week's factor performance (vs. S&P 500):

| Factor | Weekly Return | MTD |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Value (HML) | +1.8% | +2.3% |
| Momentum (UMD) | -0.9% | -1.2% |
| Size (SMB) | +0.4% | +0.6% |
| Quality (QMJ) | +0.2% | +0.5% |
| Low Vol | +0.6% | +0.8% |

**The Takeaway**: Value is having a moment. The hawkish Fed minutes released Wednesday sent long-duration growth stocks lower, while shorter-duration value names held firm. If you've been underweight value, this week's rotation is a reminder of why factor diversification matters. Momentum's stumble was modest but notable—the first negative week in six.

**MARKET THROUGH A FACTOR LENS**

**Why the Fed Minutes Sparked a Value Rally**

Wednesday's release of December Fed minutes confirmed what markets feared: rate cuts are off the table for now. The immediate reaction—tech stocks down 2%, financials up 1%—seemed like straightforward "growth vs. value." But the factor story is more nuanced.

The real shift was in duration exposure. Growth stocks are long-duration assets—their value depends heavily on cash flows far in the future. When rates rise (or stay elevated longer), those distant cash flows are discounted more heavily. Value stocks, with more immediate earnings, are shorter duration.

This matters for your portfolio: if you're heavily tilted toward growth (as most S&P 500 investors are), you're implicitly betting rates will come down. Every "higher for longer" signal hurts.

What should you do? Not necessarily rotate into value—that ship may have sailed for this move. But check your factor exposures. If you're heavily growth-tilted, understand that you're making an interest rate bet whether you intended to or not.

**Bottom Line**: The Fed isn't just setting monetary policy. It's influencing which factor wins.

**CHART OF THE WEEK**

[Chart: Value vs. Growth Spread Since 2020]

**What You're Seeing**: The cumulative return difference between value and growth stocks since January 2020. After growth dominated through 2021, value has clawed back significantly—though it remains behind the 2020 starting point.

**Why It Matters**: We may be in a factor regime shift. The last decade belonged to growth. The next might look different. Your portfolio positioning should reflect your view on this.

**ASK THE ANALYST**

*"I own 40 stocks across different sectors, but my portfolio seems to move exactly with the S&P 500. What's going on?"* — Michael R., Denver

Great observation, Michael. You're experiencing what we call "closet indexing"—your portfolio looks diversified but behaves like the index.

Here's why: Sector diversification doesn't equal factor diversification. You could own 40 stocks across all 11 sectors and still have near-identical factor exposures to the S&P 500. If your stocks have similar beta, similar value/growth characteristics, and similar correlations to each other, you're essentially holding a more expensive index fund.

The fix: Look beyond sectors. Check your factor exposures using SigmaSight. You might find you're heavily concentrated in market beta, large cap, and momentum—just like the index. True diversification requires diversifying across factors, not just ticker symbols.

**FROM THE BLOG**

**Momentum: Why Winners Keep Winning (Until They Don't)**

Momentum has been the strongest factor historically—but it comes with a catch. When it reverses, it crashes hard. This week's momentum weakness is a timely reminder of why understanding your exposure matters.
